# professional-bookshelf

As an Engineering Lead, my journey is driven by an unwavering pursuit of knowledge and personal growth. This repository serves as my haven, my 'Professional Bookshelf,' where I nurture my passion for learning and development, fueling my ambition to excel in my profession.

**Reading Goal:**
Within this virtual page, I curate the books that shape my professional evolution. It's not just a list; it's a testament to my commitment to becoming the best version of myself. Since 2021, my goal has been to read at least one book a month, both fiction and non-fiction. However, in this repository, I exclusively track books related to my career:

- **Software Engineering:** Remaining technically proficient is essential for an effective engineering lead. My aim isn't to delve deeply into a single technology but to gain insight into a multitude of topics, broadening my knowledge horizontally.
- **Management:** To become a better leader and manager.
- **Personal Growth:** To become a better person, to better understand people.

**Realization, Frustration, Acceptance:**
My journey into reading has led me to recognize the vast expanse of knowledge that I have yet to explore. It's impossible to conquer this boundless sea of wisdom. While frustration initially accompanied this acknowledgment, I continue to learn (and perhaps always will) the art of acceptance. Each entry here signifies my ongoing journey.

**Rapid Reading Technique:**
Amidst the whirlwind of engineering leadership, time is a precious commodity. I've realized that my current reading speed limits me to one or two books a month. Therefore, in August 2023, I began experimenting with rapid reading techniques. Though still in the early stages, I've already witnessed minor improvements. I find myself more focused during reading, with a heightened ability to comprehend the text.

My 'Professional Bookshelf' is my unwavering dedication to professional growth. Welcome to my world of continuous learning!
